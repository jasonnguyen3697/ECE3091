### .gitignore
The only meaningful files that do not need to be ignored for our PSOC projects are as follows below. Note that the Workspace is the top hierarchy of PSOC Creator and Projects are independent of each other in teams of TopDesign, Pins and code - open the one Workspace and create Projects where necessary.


Project Directory (project_name.cydsn)

* main.c
* cyapicallbacks.h
* project_name.cydwr
* project_name.cyprj
* TopDesign\project_name.cycsh
